Project Problem Statement: Blinkit Sales Analysis

Blinkit operates in a highly competitive quick-commerce market where data-driven decisions are critical for improving sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory efficiency. However, raw transactional and customer data alone does not provide actionable insights without proper analysis and visualization.
The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit’s sales data to evaluate overall revenue generation, average sales performance, product diversity, and customer satisfaction levels. By leveraging key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items Sold, and Average Customer Rating, the project aims to identify trends, performance gaps, and optimization opportunities.
Using Power BI, interactive dashboards and visualizations will be developed to help stakeholders:
